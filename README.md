# MSBD5012-Forest-type-prediction-exploration
A group project of HKUST BDT 20FALL 5012 course.
* Project details are in the following content.

### Task Description:
In this project, we predict the forest cover type (the predominant kind of tree cover) from strictly cartographic variables (opposed to remotely sensed data). To finish the classification task, we first analyze the dataset to equip the future data pre-processing and application. Then we select multiple machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regresion, Random Forests, LightGBM, Decision Tree on Spark and FNN from various machine learning packages such as Sklearn, Keras and Spark MLlib , to compare their performance. In this report, the process of data analysis, data cleaning, data normalization and hyperparameter tuning will be described to show how they affect the final classification accuracy.
